Create a cutting-edge, mobile-first website homepage for an AI-powered nature identification app, using a dramatic contrast of deep black and a rich spectrum of greens to evoke lush forests and living ecosystems. Draw inspiration from the modular, neon-accented aesthetic of worklouder.cc—but replace neon yellow and cyan with vibrant greens and organic textures. Use glassmorphism, soft shadows, and smooth animations to blend high-tech UI with natural motifs.
